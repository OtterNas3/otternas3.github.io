Use\n * {@link Client.getDsn} to retrieve the Dsn at any moment. In case the Dsn is\n * invalid, the constructor will throw a {@link SentryException}. Note that\n * without a valid Dsn, the SDK will not send any events to Sentry.\n *\n * Before sending an event via the backend, it is passed through\n * {@link BaseClient.prepareEvent} to add SDK information and scope data\n * (breadcrumbs and context). To add more custom information, override this\n * method and extend the resulting prepared event.\n *\n * To issue automatically created events (e.g. via instrumentation), use\n * {@link Client.captureEvent}. It will prepare the event and pass it through\n * the callback lifecycle. To issue auto-breadcrumbs, use\n * {@link Client.addBreadcrumb}.\n *\n * @example\n * class NodeClient extends BaseClient<NodeBackend, NodeOptions> {\n *   public constructor(options: NodeOptions) {\n *     super(NodeBackend, options);\n *   }\n *\n *   // ...\n * }\n */\nvar BaseClient = /** @class */ (function () {\n    /**\n     * Initializes this client instance.\n     *\n     * @param backendClass A constructor function to create the backend.\n     * @param options Options for the client.\n     */\n    function BaseClient(backendClass, options) {\n        /** A simple buffer holding all requests. */\n        this.buffer = new promisebuffer_1.PromiseBuffer();\n        this.backend = new backendClass(options);\n        this.options = options;\n        if (options.dsn) {\n            this.dsn = new dsn_1.Dsn(options.dsn);\n        }\n        // We have to setup the integrations in the constructor since we do not want\n        // that anyone needs to call client.install();\n        this.integrations = integration_1.setupIntegrations(this.options);\n    }\n    /**\n     * @inheritDoc\n     */\n    BaseClient.prototype.install = function () {\n        if (!this.isEnabled()) {\n            return (this.installed = false);\n        }\n        var backend = this.getBackend();\n        if (!this.installed && backend.install) {\n            backend.install();\n        }\n        return (this.installed = true);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @inheritDoc\n     */\n    BaseClient.prototype.captureException = function (exception, hint, scope) {\n        return tslib_1.__awaiter(this, void 0, void 0, function () {\n            var _this = this;\n            return tslib_1.__generator(this, function (_a) {\n                return [2 /*return*/, this.buffer.add((function () { return tslib_1.__awaiter(_this, void 0, void 0, function () {\n                        var event;\n                        return tslib_1.__generator(this, function (_a) {\n                            switch (_a.label) {\n                                case 0: return [4 /*yield*/, this.getBackend().eventFromException(exception, hint)];\n                                case 1:\n                                    event = _a.sent();\n                                    return [2 /*return*/, this.captureEvent(event, hint, scope)];\n                            }\n                        });\n                    }); })())];\n            });\n        });\n    };\n    /**\n     * @inheritDoc\n     */\n    BaseClient.prototype.captureMessage = function (message, level, hint, scope) {\n        return tslib_1.__awaiter(this, void 0, void 0, function () {\n            var _this = this;\n            return tslib_1.__generator(this, function (_a) {\n                return [2 /*return*/, this.buffer.add((function () { return tslib_1.__awaiter(_this, void 0, void 0, function () {\n                        var event, _a;\n                        return tslib_1.__generator(this, function (_b) {\n                            switch (_b.label) {\n                                case 0:\n                                    if (!is_1.isPrimitive(message)) return [3 /*break*/, 2];\n                                    return [4 /*yield*/, this.getBackend().eventFromMessage(\"\" + message, level, hint)];\n                                case 1:\n                                    _a = _b.sent();\n                                    return [3 /*break*/, 4];\n                                case 2: return [4 /*yield*/, this.getBackend().eventFromException(message, hint)];\n                                case 3:\n                                    _a = _b.sent();\n                                    _b.label = 4;\n                                case 4:\n                                    event = _a;\n                                    return [2 /*return*/, this.captureEvent(event, hint, scope)];\n                            }\n                        });\n                    }); })())];\n            });\n        });\n    };\n    /**\n     * @inheritDoc\n     */\n    BaseClient.prototype.captureEvent = function (event, hint, scope) {\n        return tslib_1.__awaiter(this, void 0, void 0, function () {\n            var _this = this;\n            return tslib_1.__generator(this, function (_a) {\n                // Adding this here is technically not correct since if you call captureMessage/captureException it's already\n                // buffered.
